This theme has three text box options

The Default, Hoshido, and Nohr.

The Default one is set by... well.. default.

To change to a different text box design, rename the current chat.png to its respective
file name, i.e: Default, Nohr, Hoshido.

then rename the desired one to chat.png, and reload ingame.
