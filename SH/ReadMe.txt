Cool Unknown commands are
/me = Replaces /me with your Name.
| = Line Break. Used in Server description too.
"one space" = Blank post. Makes all UI vanish.



Oh, run VNORemix B3.exe to start VNO. It's in the folder!

> How do I change VNO's features to be how I like it?!

- Settings.ini. You can change your theme, ping SFX, Music Effects,
and tons more inside this .INI File. Read all the comments to see what
does what. It's simple really!






> How do I change the theme?

VNO Folder -> Data -> Settings.ini   <--- Open that in NotePad.
Design.ini = TWEWY by default. You edit the "TWEWY" with any theme you
want. The Themes are in the Folder labeled "UI". See which
theme in there you like. Copy Folder name, and replace "TWEWY" with that name.
If you misname the theme, your VNO.exe WILL Fuck up.

> How do I make a Character?

Char Emote Size: 480x280
Button Size (for Emotes): 40x40
RosterImage / Items: 60x60
BigArt: 210x590
Anything Else: Just check the dimmensions of what you wanna replace.

Simply copy whats already made in VNO. Place Image, save.
Make the char .INI's similar to what we did. Its simple really.
We made Template Folders / Chars for you!

Same applies to making Themes, Items... anything really!




> How do I Ping people?

- The Pinglist.txt in your folder will contain all the words that
YOU, yes, YOU. Want VNO to ping you with. If somebody types anything in
that .txt, your VNO will light up and play an SFX. (You can turn off the
SFX from Settings Menu in VNO, in a Server.)

You will need to add your name, nickname, in caps or lowercase, to
the .txt. This way you can customize how often you want to get pinged.
You don't actually need the "@". It just makes things easier.





> How do I turn on ANY Feature?

- Check out the Settings button!
- We have toggles to be in HIDE MODE (Hiding from Room Scans),
Music carrying over from rooms, One Sided Music tracks, first person mode,
and tons more!



--------------------------------------------------




> How do I get into a roleplay???>!!!!!@3123123

Well, VNO was made for roleplays mainly.
So. Get into a somewhat populated server (you only need 1 pal for a RP)
and... get out there! Chat it up! Establish a scene, setting, character trait!

Create a whacky scene and see who follows, or, join an event in progress!
Ask around, don't be shy! You won't get anywhere that way!
Gotta be a leader, not a follower! Tons of server hosts are open to letting
people RP with them, or go host your own place! If you can't host your own
Server, ask people to host your RP idea on their server! You can't go wrong!

I have seen Roleplay Events with 3 ppl have the same value as RP's with
20 people. Popular examples are TTG's DR RP's, Dungeon!, or Our Last Hour.

The offcial VNO Youtube Channel has some uploads.

Roleplays can be about combat, or story, or mystery. Remix has features to
support all these kinds of Roleplays, so go nuts! For more feature info, read on!

(To get the 'VNO User' Tag, ask in #general for it.)

> How do I swap Themes without ReLoading VNO?

Press F9. The other F buttons are macro's to toggle Settings btw.





> How do I host a Server?

See this WIP link:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-wt9O7WcBeoj3qVN7-oXLv7rJYuyVPYLja5NW4S2ZEE/edit?copiedFromTrash


OR


Open a Port (Google it). Use port in the Settings.ini of your VNO Server Folder. 
Edit everything in that Server Folder. Voila! Done. See server rules here:

http://visualnovelonline.com/rules




> How do I roll Dice? Use Items? See Cooldowns? See HP Bars? Scan Rooms? Macro's?!

- Event Tab will show a Dice box with "2d6" in it. Type in the dice
you want to roll (# of dice)d(number of sides), then ENTER.
Your roll will appear on EVENT Tab! Use the Menu buttons on
the bottom Center to access Shop/Inventory. Click the items
picture to "reveal" the item, and the trash can to discard it.

- Each item may have a cooldown, and will tell you when it runs out.
Items can be used on OTHER users via their Target ID, type it in
and press USE on the Item (The Target Button), and the item will
get used up, changing the targets HP or MP.
The Item's Cooldown, intended use or actual effect is determined
by the Servers Items.ini file, so the host is the mastermind here!

- What are my COOL Ease of access Macro's?!
You have two kinds. To Navigate Emotes with arrow keys, hold ALT
and use left or right to move up one emote, or down one emote. Use UP
or DOWN to skip pages.
For Items, hold CONTROL plus up or down to navigate your INVENTORY
(assuming its open) and press CONTROL+SPACE to use the item. To refresh
the item list, press CONTROL+ALT. Your Inventory will refresh everytime
you open it, press the refresh UI button, or use this macro. It will also Auto
refresh when one of your items reaches 0.

- Want to hide from people scanning you? Goto settings and toggle HIDE on/off!
You will be hidden from the public! (BUT NOT MODS).

- Any user can edit their own HP and MP!


- Press F7 or access settings Menu button to show HP Bars.




> There are Events, Contests and Roleplays, right? How will I know?

Simply ask a Mod, or see the Tumblr for such Event announcements.
Be warned though, if its a small scale RP Event, it won't ask for many
people. However, if its a BIG TOURNAMENT based on PvP, we'll make sure
to have you all know it, trust me!







> How do I PvP? Thats what the HP Bars are for, right?

- See this Link

But we encourage you to make up your own Fight System if you want!
Get creative, do Tabletop stuff! YOU HAVE THE ROLEPLAY TOOLS! USE 'EM.

Animators can use the Animator UI to set/increase the Max HP Values of anyone.
You can access Animator UI too to edit your own HP and MP.




> I see Items! Shops! Gifting! How do I do that stuff!!!

In the Menu buttons, click the shop Icon (varies from theme to theme).
You will need CREDITS earned by... well. Depends on the Server!
Each server has mods and Animators suited to the job of handing out
items, money, and changing HP/MP of users!




-----------------------------------------------------------------





> How do I Save / Playback Replays for Pals?

There is a floppy disk Icon at the bottom center of your UI. Press it and
it saves everything your perspective saw. Songs and all. Rolls too.

When you want to play Replays back, open up mod UI and place your
desired replay in the servers REPLAY Folder. Then press on a Room, and
put the filename "Name.txt" into the Blank space on the bottom left. Then press
play!


> I'm an Animator! What can I do?

- Check your Anim UI, it should be expanded now!
You can edit peoples items, money, and HP/MP!

You can Start a Server TIMER, or put up a picture!
If you're confused, use the build in tooltip to help!
(Hover cursor over something and tips will show!)





> Is there MORE STUFF I CAN DOWNLOAD????!!!

Visit other peoples servers! (Ones that ARE NOT Official Vanilla Server)

Aside that, other Servers have a .www button that leads to
their own Content. Go Download theirs!

Here is a list of contributed content to VNO, write on it!

> Can I ping people like Discord? Can I go AFK, mute VNO and get pinged?

- Yes! Edit what words you'd like to ping your VNO client, in the Pinglist.txt,
included in VNO's folder. You can turn on the Ping SFX via Settings menu in a Server.
You can even change what SFX you want to be your ping, in the Settings.ini!
